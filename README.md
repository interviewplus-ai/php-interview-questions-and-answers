## What is PHP and what are its features?

PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor, and it is a server-side scripting language used for web development. Its features include:

- Simple syntax and easy to learn
- Open source and free to use
- Platform independent
- Supports a wide range of databases
- Easily integrates with HTML
- Supports OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

## What are the differences between GET and POST methods in PHP?

GET and POST are HTTP methods used to send data to a web server. The differences between the two are as follows:

- GET sends data as part of the URL, while POST sends data in the request body
- GET has a limit on the amount of data that can be sent (typically 2048 characters), while POST has no limit
- GET is less secure than POST, as the data is visible in the URL

In PHP, GET data can be accessed using the $_GET superglobal, while POST data can be accessed using the $_POST superglobal.

Example:
```php
<form action="process.php" method="POST">
    <input type="text" name="username">
    <input type="password" name="password">
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```
In the above example, the form data is sent using the POST method, and the username and password fields can be accessed in PHP using $_POST['username'] and $_POST['password'].

## Explain what is meant by the term "superglobal" in PHP, and give an example of one.

Superglobals are predefined variables in PHP that are always available in any scope of the script. They are called "superglobals" because they are always accessible, regardless of where they are used in the script. Some examples of superglobals in PHP are:

- $_GET: contains the GET parameters sent to the script
- $_POST: contains the POST parameters sent to the script
- $_SERVER: contains information about the server and environment
- $_COOKIE: contains the cookies sent to the script
- $_SESSION: contains session variables set for the script

Example:
```php
<?php
// Accessing the 'name' parameter sent in the URL
$name = $_GET['name'];

// Setting a session variable
session_start();
$_SESSION['user_id'] = 123;
```
## What is the difference between include() and require() in PHP?

Both include() and require() are used to include a file in a PHP script. The main difference between the two is that require() will produce a fatal error and stop the script execution if the file cannot be included, while include() will only produce a warning and continue the script execution. In other words, require() is more strict than include().

Example:
```php
<?php
// This will produce a warning if file.php cannot be found
include('file.php');

// This will produce a fatal error if file.php cannot be found
require('file.php');
```
## What is a session in PHP and how is it used?

A session is a way to store information (variables) on the server between page requests from the same user. It allows the web application to identify a user and keep track of their activity. Sessions are typically used to store user authentication data, such as login credentials or user preferences. In PHP, a session is started using the session_start() function, which creates a unique session ID for the user and stores it in a cookie on the user's computer. The session variables can be accessed using the $_SESSION superglobal.

Example:
```php
<?php
// Starting a session
session_start();

// Storing a variable in the session
$_SESSION['user_id'] = 123;

// Retrieving the variable from the session
$user_id = $_SESSION['user_id'];
```
## What is an interface in PHP and how is it used?

An interface in PHP is a blueprint of a set of methods that a class must implement. It defines the signature (name, parameters, and return type) of the methods, but not their implementation. Classes that implement an interface must define all of the methods in the interface, or they will produce a fatal error. An interface is defined using the interface keyword.

Example:
```php
<?php
interface Shape {
    public function area();
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    private $width;
    private $height;
    
    public function __construct($w, $h) {
        $this->width = $w;
        $this->height = $h;
    }
    
    public function area() {
        return $this->width * $this->height;
    }
}

$rectangle = new Rectangle(5, 10);
echo $rectangle->area(); // Output: 50
```
## What is a trait in PHP and how is it used?

A trait in PHP is a way to reuse code in multiple classes without using inheritance. It allows a set of methods to be reused in multiple classes, without having to define them in each class. A trait is defined using the trait keyword, and can be included in a class using the use keyword.

Example:
```php
<?php
trait Log {
    public function log($message) {
        echo $message;
    }
}

class User {
    use Log;
    
    public function login() {
        // Login logic
        $this->log('User logged in.');
    }
}

$user = new User();
$user->login(); // Output: User logged in.
```
## What is the difference between include() and require() in PHP?

include() and require() are both used to include files in PHP, but there is a difference between the two. include() includes the specified file and generates a warning if the file is not found, while require() includes the specified file and generates a fatal error if the file is not found. This means that if a file is required, the script will not continue to execute if the file is missing, whereas if a file is included, the script will continue to execute.

## What is a namespace in PHP?

A namespace is a way of encapsulating a group of related functions, classes, and constants in PHP to prevent naming collisions with functions, classes, and constants of the same name in other parts of a program. Namespaces are declared using the namespace keyword at the beginning of a file.

## How can you upload files in PHP?

Files can be uploaded in PHP using the $_FILES superglobal array and the move_uploaded_file() function. The $_FILES array contains information about the uploaded file, including its name, type, size, and location on the server. The move_uploaded_file() function is used to move the uploaded file from its temporary location to a permanent location on the server.

Example:

```php
<?php
$target_dir = "uploads/";
$target_file = $target_dir . basename($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["name"]);
$uploadOk = 1;

// Check if file already exists
if (file_exists($target_file)) {
    echo "Sorry, file already exists.";
    $uploadOk = 0;
}

// Check file size
if ($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["size"] > 500000) {
    echo "Sorry, your file is too large.";
    $uploadOk = 0;
}

// Allow only certain file types
$imageFileType = strtolower(pathinfo($target_file,PATHINFO_EXTENSION));
if($imageFileType != "jpg" && $imageFileType != "png" && $imageFileType != "jpeg"
&& $imageFileType != "gif" ) {
    echo "Sorry, only JPG, JPEG, PNG & GIF files are allowed.";
    $uploadOk = 0;
}

// Check if $uploadOk is set to 0 by an error
if ($uploadOk == 0) {
    echo "Sorry, your file was not uploaded.";
// If everything is ok, try to upload file
} else {
    if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["tmp_name"], $target_file)) {
        echo "The file ". htmlspecialchars( basename( $_FILES["fileToUpload"]["name"])). " has been uploaded.";
    } else {
        echo "Sorry, there was an error uploading your file.";
    }
}
```
## What is the use of the header() function in PHP?

The header() function in PHP is used to send a raw HTTP header to the client. It is typically used to set response codes, redirect the user to another page, or set cookies. The header() function must be called before any actual output is sent to the browser.

## What is an abstract class in PHP?

An abstract class in PHP is a class that cannot be instantiated directly, but can only be used as a base class for other classes. Abstract classes are used to define a common interface for a group of classes that have similar behavior or properties. Abstract classes can contain abstract methods, which are defined in the abstract class but implemented in the child classes.

Example:

```php
<?php
abstract class Shape {
    protected $color;

    public function __construct($color = 'red') {
        $this->color = $color;
    }

    abstract protected function getArea();
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    protected $radius;

    public function __construct($radius, $color = 'red') {
        parent::__construct($color);
        $this->radius = $radius;
    }

    public function getArea() {
        return pi() * pow($this->radius, 2);
    }
}

$circle = new Circle(5);
echo $circle->getArea();
```

## What is a trait in PHP?

A trait in PHP is a way to reuse code in multiple classes without creating a hierarchy of inheritance. Traits are similar to classes, but they cannot be instantiated and do not define properties or constants. Instead, they define methods that can be reused by other classes.

Example:
```php
<?php
trait Greeting {
    public function sayHello() {
        echo 'Hello';
    }
}

class Person {
    use Greeting;

    public function sayName() {
        echo 'My name is John.';
    }
}

$person = new Person();
$person->sayHello(); // Output: Hello
$person->sayName(); // Output: My name is John.
```

## What is a closure in PHP?

A closure in PHP is an anonymous function that can be assigned to a variable and passed as an argument to another function. Closures can access variables from the parent scope, even if those variables are not passed as arguments. Closures are useful for creating functions that can be used in a flexible way.

Example:
```php
<?php
function add($x) {
    return function($y) use ($x) {
        return $x + $y;
    };
}

$add5 = add(5);
echo $add5(3); // Output: 8
```

## What is the use of the static keyword in PHP?

The static keyword in PHP is used to declare a static variable or method in a class. A static variable is a variable that is shared among all instances of the class, while a static method is a method that can be called without instantiating the class. Static variables and methods are accessed using the class name, rather than an instance of the class.

Example:
```php
<?php
class Counter {
    private static $count = 0;

    public static function getCount() {
        return self::$count;
    }

    public function increment() {
        self::$count++;
    }
}

$counter1 = new Counter();
$counter2 = new Counter();
$counter1->increment();
$counter2->increment();
echo Counter::getCount(); // Output: 2
```
